# Message Variables

Message variables are a way to dynamically adjust the content of your message based on the context. This is especially useful in responses to custom commands and interactive components.

To use a variable in your message just put `{variable_name}` where you want the value to appear. For example put `{user.mention}` in your message content to ping the user that has used a command.
