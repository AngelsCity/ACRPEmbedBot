# Save Messages

Embed Generator allows you to store your created messages in the cloud and even share them with your other server administrators.

You can access saved messages from any device by logging in with your Discord account. You can decide to save your messages to your personal Discord account or save them to one of your Discord servers so all the admins can access them.
