# Tutorial

Hello and welcome to the tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating an embed using Embed Generator.

## 1. (Optional, but highly recommended): Sign in and add the bot.

To simplify the process of sending the message, you should sign into the site with your Discord account and add the bot to your server.
### Sign in
 - First, go to https://message.style/app/, then click the three-dots in the top-middle.
 - Click on the login button.
 - Authorise access to your account. You may be asked for a username and password if you aren't already logged into Discord.
 - You are now signed in!
 ### Add bot to server
 - Go back to https://message.style/app/ and click the three dots. 
 - Now click invite bot.
 - Choose a server to add the bot to. You must have 'manage server' permissions in the server you want to add the bot to.
 - Click continue. The bot should join your server.
 - (Optional) If using a reaction-role gate, give the bot the required role for it to function.
 - The bot is now in the server!
 
 ## 2. Create a message
