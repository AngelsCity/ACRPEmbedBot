Discohook is a popular tool for creating Discord embed messages using Webhooks. Sadly it's not perfect ...
For many features an additional bot is needed and the setup can be confusing. Additionally the uptime has been far from perfect recently.

TLDR: [Embed Generator](https://message.style) is the superior alternative to Discohook in terms of features, usability, and stability.

## Overview of Discohook

Discohook is an open source service that allows users to create good looking embed messages for their Discord server.

Discord embed messages are commonly used by Discord server owners to make their announcement messages look better and give them a bit more strucutre. Without external tools like Discohook the formatting of messages in Discord is quite limited.

To send these messages Discohook uses so called Webhooks. Discord allows server owner to create Webhooks for their channels which can then be copied into tools Discohook to send a message to that channel. While Webhooks are good for many purposes they are no very beginner friendly and also lack some important features.

Discohook lets users create "backups" of their messages which they can restore at a later point. This way users can work on multiple messages without loosing progress. These message backups are sadly only stored locally and are not synchronized across the devices of the user. Sometimes they are even deleted when the user clears their browser cache.

While the most basic features of Discohook are easily accessible through their website, for more advanced features like scheduled messages and interactive components you have to leave their website and invite a third party bot or even install a browser extension.

## The need for a Discohook alternative

Discohook is a great service for creating Discord embed messages and it's understandable that many users like it. It allows designing and structuring Discord messages in a way that isn't possible out of the box with Discord.

Sadly Discohook hasn't seen any active development in the last fear years and is falling behind the competition. It lacks support for newer Discord features and is only really suitable for static messages.

While you can use other third party services to augment the features of Discohook to add support for interactive components and scheduled messages, this isn't user or beginner friendly at all.

In the last few months Discohook has experienced an increasing amount of downtime. Users weren't able to access the website, send messages or access their backups. While this is certainly not a good sign, we understand the difficulties of financing a service purely with donations.

This is why there is a need for a good Discohook alternative that is actively maintained, user friendly, and supports all of the important features out of the box.
